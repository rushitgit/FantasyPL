1,"If I need Cameron Archer to come on, then that's what he's there for. Yeah, right. Oscar, your team's up next. Now, of course, you told us you'd already sold Haaland. So, who have you brought in to replace him? Drumroll. Yeah, it was Solanke. Solanke�s come in for a hit. Yeah, I think I've already had Watkins. I think he's just the obvious pick with those fixtures. He's second for expected goal-in-a-bombing over the last four game weeks. He's taken 14 shots in the box, which is topping the league over that run. And yeah, the other transfer was Kabore to Pedro Porro. We've got four game weeks in the next 15 days, so loads of FPL, but the consequence of that is there's lots of unexpected rotations. So I really like Porro because he's completely nailed. He starts every game, big upgrade on Kabore. And yeah, because I've sold Haaland for a Solanke, I've got 8.1 million in the bank, so I could put another Solanke actually. But yeah, it all depends on how the Harlan used. I'll probably redistribute that 8.1 million to someone like Trippier or Trent in gameweek 18. My main worry is obviously Gordon, who's flagged. Eddie Howe said it's going to be a late fitness test on him. But I did also read just now that Barnes has had a setback on his return, so no Barnes till January, of course, would have been competition for Gordon. So at least that is beneficial to Gordon's expected minutes going forward. Yeah, absolutely right. Mark, how's your team shaping up? Let's have a look. Yeah, plenty of flags here as well. All depends on the Haaland News today. I really need to see a very positive updates, not to sell them. So if I don't see that... What I would like to do is use the Haaland injury as an excuse to finally get Bukayo Saka back in. So I'm looking at a possible minus four, Haaland to Solanke because they already have Watkins, and then Marvelous Nakamba upgraded to Saka with the Haaland money. And that would mean I would just bench Anthony Gordon because he's a doubt, but I do like him for the two game weeks after this one. And then it would be get Haaland back on a wild card, either game week 19 or game week 20, probably by losing Salah. around that point. So I think our friends and family are going to get a lot of nice gifts this year because we won't have a lot of cash if we sell Haaland today."
2,"We all knew from last week how important having a vice captain is. Obviously you can see behind us the option Salah. Man United, Son, Forrest, Saka, Brighton, Haaland of course, playing, playing, I don't know if he is playing, Crystal Palace. Sam, what are your thoughts? Who are you captaining for game week 17? Even if Haaland is fit, Salah's getting the armband. Oh, that's such a bum! I know, he's getting the armband regardless. He loves to score against Manchester United, I think 12-12 appearances for him. The most he's ever scored against the club is against Manchester United. He's not blanked at home all season this year. Liverpool are in fantastic form. You look at Manchester United, Bruno Fernandes is suspended this week. Everybody in their defence seems to have been injured or are doubt for this weekend. They're not keeping clean sheets. I don't think that there's a nicer fixture this weekend for Mo Salah as a fan. Man United fans are not gonna like that. I know, they won't enjoy that. But at the moment, I think that's just the way that it is because Liverpool are in great form, they're playing really well. Europa League performance last night aside, but. Yeah, I just think that Salah this weekend is the best goalkeeper. Yeah. Oscar, quickly, who are you captaining this week? Yeah, it's Salah for me as well. I read an interesting stat this morning. The last seven times that Liverpool have played Man United at home, Liverpool have got 20 goals and Man United have got one. Captain Salah. Ah, and Mark, what about you? Who are you captaining? Yeah, a hat-trick of Salah shouts here. Like Sam said, even if we get good news in Holland... I've been on Salah all week and I don't see that changing. Oh gosh, you guys have confused me now because I was like, I'm just so scared not to give the armband to Harlan but maybe now I'm thinking Salah. I think Salah's the best option. What about Son away at Forest? Son's a great option. Don't like the early game. I don't like that. It's been someone in the early kickoff, it ruins my weekends and it's a Friday night as well so, but I do think he's a really nice option on the back of a 17 point haul against Newcastle at the weekend and we now know he's on penalties too. Yeah, absolutely."
3, "Solanke appears as the optimal short-term choice, boasting favorable form, fixtures, and promising underlying statistics at just £6.6m. Matheus Cunha, with his consistent performance and impressive goal stats, also seems likely to deliver ongoing returns. However, Jimenez's unsustainable 33.3% goal conversion rate, coupled with Fulham's upcoming match against Newcastle, introduces a higher risk in acquiring him. As the Asian Cup and Africa Cup of Nations kick off in Gameweek 21, the substantial price tags of Salah and Son may prompt Fantasy managers to allocate more funds to their forward lines, making Gabriel Jesus a viable consideration at that time."
