So, who have you brought in to replace him? Drumroll. Yeah, it was Solanke. Solankeâ€™s come in for a hit. Yeah, I think I've already had Watkins. I think he's just the obvious pick with those fixtures. He's second for expected goal-in-a-bombing over the last four game weeks. He's taken 14 shots in the box, which is topping the league over that run.")
